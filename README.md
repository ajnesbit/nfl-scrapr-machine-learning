# NFL model for predicting outcomes of contests

## Objective

The goal of this project is to find out which moving average statistics provide the best results for predicting outcomes of contests for their upcoming game. The intention of this is to apply the code to the upcoming season and analyze the results of the model in real time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help run the model (contained in the .ipynb file)

### Prerequisites

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installing

* Install Visual Studio Code
* Download repository to your device
* Open repository folder in Visual Studio Code
* open .ipynb folder by typing jupyter notebook into terminal of Visual Studio Code
* Run all cells of the nfl_data_model.ipynb file


## Running the tests

Open the notebook, run all cells.
